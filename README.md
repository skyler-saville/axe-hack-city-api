## Interconnections Between Files

This section outlines how different files within the project interact to handle API requests and manage data flow. Each component has a specific role in maintaining a clean architecture and ensuring separation of concerns.

### 1. **Routers (`routers/`)**
- **Purpose**: Define API endpoints and handle incoming requests.
- **Interconnections**:
  - **Imports the relevant controller** for handling business logic (e.g., `from ..controllers.<entity>_controller import <Entity>Controller`).
  - **Imports request and response schemas** for data validation (e.g., `from ..schemas.<entity>_schema import <Entity>CreateSchema, <Entity>Schema`).

### 2. **Controllers (`controllers/`)**
- **Purpose**: Serve as intermediaries between routers and repositories, containing business logic.
- **Interconnections**:
  - **Imports the repository** for database operations (e.g., `from ..database.sqlalchemy_repository import SQLAlchemyRepository`).
  - **Imports the model** representing the database entity (e.g., `from ..models.<entity>_model import <Entity>`).

### 3. **Repositories (`database/`)**
- **Purpose**: Handle all database interactions using SQLAlchemy, abstracting the database layer.
- **Interconnections**:
  - **Does not import routers or controllers**, ensuring it remains independent.
  - **Works with models** that represent the structure of database entities (e.g., `from ..models.<entity>_model import <Entity>`).

### 4. **Models (`models/`)**
- **Purpose**: Define the structure of database entities using SQLAlchemy ORM.
- **Interconnections**:
  - **Should not import any other modules**; it exists solely to define data structures.

### 5. **Schemas (`schemas/`)**
- **Purpose**: Define Pydantic models for request and response validation.
- **Interconnections**:
  - **Does not need to import routers or controllers**, operating independently to provide validation functionality.

### Example Flow for API Requests

1. **Client sends a request** (e.g., POST, GET) to an endpoint defined in the router.
2. **Router validates the request** against the schema and calls the corresponding controller method.
3. **Controller processes the request**, applying business logic and invoking methods from the repository.
4. **Repository interacts with the database** using the model to perform the required operations.
5. **Repository returns the result** to the controller, which formats the response.
6. **Router sends the response** back to the client, completing the request-response cycle.

### Benefits of this Structure
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a clear responsibility, making the code easier to manage and extend.
- **Testability**: Isolated components can be tested independently, improving the overall quality of the application.
- **Scalability**: New features and endpoints can be added without significant modifications to existing code.
